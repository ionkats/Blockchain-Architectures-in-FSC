The ids are not for every case (eg. of tomatoes) but for every few cases (batch). 
The numbering remains the same all throughout the trip from the starting state to the ending state.

Ledgers 1ου επιπέδου: 1 public ledger for anchoring
Ledgers 2ου επιπέδου: 1 private ledger for anchoring
Ledgers 3ου επιπέδου: multiple private ledgers for data

There is a Manager/Coordinator who decides where the next state activation is placed (in which ledger).
Eg in Farm state: when the seeds are planted this state is activated for the analogous session ids and 
from that timestamp data are saved from the sensors, the frequency and the quantity of the data is 
determined by the orginization (we must find/decide a mean amount per minute for calculations and for 
an upper limit?). When the item is cropped and removed from the field then that session is deactivated 
and there are no longer any data transactions from the sensors/farmer. Accordinlgy this applies to all states,
eg. transport (activation when item is taken from driver, deactivation when item is handed off to the next state)

There is a limit for a number of currently active sessions in a ledger (based on amount of data saved or 
#transactions that didn't get in the block or ...). Before the limit is exceeded the next session that 
need to be activated is being sent to a new ledger (defined by the manager) to avoid any collisions.

We begin with a base of anchoring in 2nd layer private ledger every block of every ledger in the 3rd layer.
Anchoring is cheap, especially in private ledgers.
